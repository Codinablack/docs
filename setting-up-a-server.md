# Setting up your first server

When setting up your first server, things may seem quite tedious to look at, but it will certainly get easier as we go.

##### Downloading a data pack

##### Installing a text editor

##### Database

##### Server Engine \(The Forgotten Server\)

##### DLL Files \(maybe include this as a part of TFS?\)
