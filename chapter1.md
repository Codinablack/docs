# What is Open Tibia?

Open Tibia \(abbreviated as OT\) is an open-source role-playing game with which people may create their own servers for the public to play. They may have unique content with their own maps and features, and different skill/level rates than the original Tibia.

With Open Tibia, along comes an Open Tibia community, a community of players like you who want to create something of their own. People within this community help each other, provide tutorials, contribute to the development of new and improved servers, and more.
